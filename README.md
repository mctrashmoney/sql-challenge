## About

This has been separated into three directories:
- CSV/ #Contains the CSV files
- DBD/ #Contains the ERD image and a txt on how it was produced
- SQL/ #Contains sql files for:
    - First file:
        - Creating the tables in the database
        - Automating the importing of the CSV files
    - Second file:
        - Queries

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
```pgsql
SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, e.sex, s.salary
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;
```

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
```pgsql
SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '1986-01-01' AND '1986-12-31';
```

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
```pgsql
SELECT dm.dept_no, d.dept_name, dm.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name
FROM dept_manager dm
INNER JOIN departments d ON dm.dept_no = d.dept_no
INNER JOIN employees e ON dm.emp_no = e.emp_no;
```

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
```pgsql
SELECT de.dept_no, e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN dept_emp de ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no;
```

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
```pgsql
SELECT first_name, last_name, sex
FROM employees
WHERE LOWER(first_name) = 'hercules' 
	AND LOWER(last_name) LIKE 'b%';
```

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
```pgsql
SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN dept_emp de ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
WHERE d.dept_name IN ('Sales');
```

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
```pgsql
SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN dept_emp de ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
WHERE d.dept_name IN ('Sales', 'Development');
```

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
```pgsql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

### Issues and lessons learned
* In the creating of the tables, I tried automating the importing the CSVs as well, which led to some errors in the directory which I had to consult with ChatGPT, hence the commentary in the middle of the [SQL file](https://github.com/mctrashmoney/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/data/SQL/create_import_tables.sql)
* In the fourth query I specifically forgot to list the department number, so I had to add it last minute.
